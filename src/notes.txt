/*
To create a package, use the package keyword at the top of your Java source file.
*/
package com.example.myapp; // Declare a package 
    public class MyClass { 
        // Class code goes here
    }
}

The folder structure on your filesystem should match the package declaration. 
For instance, if your package is com.example.myapp, your source file should be located in the following path example.
└/src
└── com         <-- Level 1: Matches 'com'
    └── example   <-- Level 2: Matches 'example'
        └── myapp   <-- Level 3: Matches 'myapp'
            └── MyClass.java── example

/* 
In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects and can contain 
methods (functions) that define behaviors. For instance, the second line
of this code displays the public class library, with methods like 
calculatePrice() or applyDiscount().
*/
package com.example.library;  
public class Library  {
    private List <Book> books; // Private attribute to hold books  
    public Library() {
        books = new ArrayList<>(); // Initialize the list in the constructor 
    } 
    public void addBook(Book book) {
        books.add(book); // Method to add a book to the library 
    }
}

/*
Every Java application needs an entry point, which is typically a main
method within a public class. In this code, the second line of code 
identifies the method named Main in the public class.
*/
package com.example.library;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library(); // Create an instance of Library
        // Add books to the library 
        library.addBook(new Book("1984", "George Orwell"));
	library.addBook(new Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee"));
	// Display all books 
	library.displayBooks();
    }
}
